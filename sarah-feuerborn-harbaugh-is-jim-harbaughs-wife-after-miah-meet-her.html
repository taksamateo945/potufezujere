At the time, Jim was the head coach at the University of San Diego and was attending a convention for coaches in Las Vegas. Jim instantly fell in love with her and politely demanded her number.</p><p>Although she gave him the number, he felt it was the typical ladies’ way of dishing out fake numbers to men whom they wanted to brush off. His suspicions were nearly confirmed when he called her nine times without her answering. However, Sarah eventually returned Jim’s call, thereby starting a love story with the celebrity coach.</p><h2><strong>Sarah Feuerborn Harbaugh Became Jim Harbaugh’s Wife in 2008</strong></h2><p>After Jim had just concluded the divorce proceedings with his first wife Miah, there were speculations that Jim had already begun dating Sarah while still married to his wife and that this was a major cause of the divorce between the pair. However, neither of them has debunked or confirmed the rumors.</p><p>Two years after they began dating, Jim and Sarah got married on January 5, 2008, at a small ceremony and have remained happily together ever since. Their union has lasted for 15 years and there has been no scandal or controversy trailing their relationship.</p><p>In 2016, Sarah appeared on CSN as a guest, after an NFL 49ers game. While on the show, she disclosed that it was difficult being married to a football coach as the results of the games somehow impact her family. Four years later during an interview with ESPN in 2010, Jim Harbaugh described his wife Sarah as a perfect wife, stating that he wouldn’t wish she did anything differently. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the celebrity couple enjoys a blissful marital life.</p><h3><strong>Sarah Feuerborn Harbaugh’s Anniversary Dates</strong></h3><table><tr><th><strong>Year</strong></th><th><strong>Month</strong></th><th><strong>Day of the Week</strong></th></tr><tbody><tr><td>2023</td><td>January</td><td>Thursday</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>January</td><td>Friday</td></tr><tr><td>2025</td><td>January</td><td>Sunday</td></tr><tr><td>2026</td><td>January</td><td>Monday</td></tr><tr><td>2027</td><td>January</td><td>Tuesday</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><strong>Meet Sarah Feuerborn Harbaugh’s Husband, Jim Harbaugh</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name</strong>: James Joseph Harbaugh</li><li><strong>Nickname</strong>: Jim Harbaugh</li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: December 23, 1963</li><li><strong>Jim Harbaugh’s Ag</strong>e: 60 years old</li><li><strong>Place of Birth</strong>: Toledo, Ohio, USA</li><li><strong>Birth Sign</strong>: Capricorn</li><li><strong>Jim Harbaugh’s Parents</strong>: Jack Harbaugh and Jackie Harbaugh</li><li><strong>Siblings</strong>: John Harbaugh and Joani Harbough</li></ul><p>James Joseph Harbaugh was born in Toledo, Ohio, the USA on December 23, 1963, and is 60 years old.
