Happy 1st anniversary <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@KaitMarieox</a> ❤ I love you! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ZVwLHaHUgV</a></p><p>— Justin Moldow (@JustinMoldow) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">March 19, 2021</a></p><p>Considering they collaborated on founding a political commentary site in 2015, it’s obvious they have known each other for a long but the exact time Kaitlin and Justin met is not known. However, their relationship grew stronger to graduate to matrimony. Moldow <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>proposed</a> to his partner on February 4, 2019, and she said yes.</p><p>Plans for the wedding were heating up when the Covid-19 pandemic struck and crippled everything. Notwithstanding, the lovebirds went ahead to exchange vows in March 2020, but on a low key. The wedding was conducted in the Catholic church where Justin holds tight to his faith. They celebrated their wedding a year later under relaxed covid-related restrictions.</p><p>Pictures of their wedding started spreading on the internet with the picture-perfect duo looking like a match made in heaven. They have remained together since then, strongly supporting each other’s passion. The lovely couple announced that they were expecting their first child in December 2021. On April 6, 2022, Kaitlin Bennett announced the birth of their first child on Twitter.</p><h3><strong>Controversies Have Trolled Their Relationship Since Their Marriage</strong></h3><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/95576bdb-b196-4ca5-ac21-0bac8211caee.jpg alt width=675 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>For a couple who have dedicated so much time to speak up about politics and social ills, there are bound to be controversies trailing their paths. One of such issues surfaced after they exchanged marriage vows and screenshots of an alleged conversation between Moldow and a mystery girl online surfaced.</p><p>The screenshots show him starting a flirty conversation with a lady and when she called him out for having a girlfriend, he pleaded with her not to tell Bennett about it. It did seem weird but he never addressed the issue.</p><h2><strong>Is Kaitlin Bennett still married to Justin Moldow?</strong></h2><p>From all indications, Kaitlin Bennett is still married to Justin Moldow. The got engaged in 2019 and later married in a Catholic ceremony in March 2020. On April 6, 2022, Kaitlin announced the birth of their first child on Twitter.</p><h3><strong>He Has Been Accused of Being Gay and Going Through Conversion Therapy Before His Wedding</strong></h3><p>In his response to this, Moldow expressed dismay that he had been called gay just because he cleaned up well for his wedding. A few weeks after the wedding, the political activist was dragged online with rumors that he subjected himself to conversion therapy before he could marry Bennett.</p><p>Conversation therapy is a process that aims to change the sexuality of LGBTQ youth. The process has been termed dangerous by the Human Rights Campaign ad. It is not encouraged due to the potential harm it might have on the individual. Moldow took to Twitter to clap back at his accusers, saying they are jealous of his happy union with a beautiful woman.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Apparently a lot of liberals on this website are calling me gay for cleaning up nice on my wedding day 😂 I think they're just in denial over the fact that they'll never have a wife as beautiful as mine. Or even find love. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/923u2UoR0r</a></p><p>— Justin Moldow (@JustinMoldow) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">April 3, 2020</a></p><h2><strong>Justin Moldow is the Founder of Liberty Hangout</strong></h2><p>Perhaps his greatest achievement so far, Justin Moldow co-founded Young Jeffersonians with Kaitlin Bennett in 2015 but the name was later changed to Liberty Hangouts. The political commentary site has grown exponentially over the years. It also has a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>YouTube channel</a>&nbsp;launched in 2015 and the channel has attracted over 600k subscribers and counting with more than 92 million views.</p><p>Aside from being the face of Liberty Hangout, Bennett is also one of the major content creators and the couple has been working together without any major issues. A self-proclaimed steadfast defender of liberty, Moldow dedicated his time and energy to grow the Liberty Hangout site to what it is today. He imbibed his marketing expertise to make wise decisions for the growth of the site. He is described as a strong supporter of libertarian thought and Austrian economics and these have helped him form his political ideologies.</p><h3><strong>Is Justin Moldow a Gun Activist Himself?</strong></h3><p lang=en dir=ltr>My new friend <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/dGrd6Nw6ek</a></p><p>— Justin Moldow (@JustinMoldow) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">October 2, 2020</a></p><p>From the tweet above, it’s obvious Justin is an advocate of gun ownership like his wife. Though he’s mostly grounded in political commentary, the Ohio resident is always in support of his wife’s pursuits and guns form a huge part of that. However, he is more focused on political commentary which is influenced by his Catholic faith. His contributions to Kaitlin’s activism works are mostly done behind the scenes, which explains why he is not as popular as the Kent State Gun Girl.</p><p>On her own part, Bennett renders her support to her husband as well. Their interests in political commentary and activism will surely form a strong bond for the couple. Their various social media accounts are littered with pictures of them doing things together and despite all the criticism and controversies that have threatened their status as a couple, they stand stronger with each passing day.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h3><strong>Who is Justin Moldow?</strong></h3><p>Justin Moldow is the husband of Kaitlin Bennett, who is widely known as Gun Girl.
