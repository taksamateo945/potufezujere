Rotted Valentine’s Day flowers, deflated balloons and other gifts are strewn about. Only the bodies and personal belongings such as backpacks have been removed.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A lock of dark hair rested on the floor where one of the victims’ bodies once lay. A single black rubber shoe was in a hallway. Browned rose petals were strewn across a hallway where six people died.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In classroom after classroom, open notebooks displayed uncompleted lesson plans: A blood-coated book called ‘Tell Them We Remember’ sat atop a bullet-riddled desk in the classroom where teacher Ivy Schamis taught students about the Holocaust. Attached to a bulletin board in the room a sign read: ‘We will never forget.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the classroom of English teacher Dara Hass, where the most students were gunned down, students had written papers about Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager who was shot by the Taliban for going to school and has since been a global advocate for educational access for women and girls.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One of the students wrote: ‘A bullet went straight to her head but not her brain.’ Another read: ‘We go to school every day of the week and we take it all for granted. We cry and complain without knowing how lucky we are to be able to learn.’</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async id=i-4c9f896b19cef950 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/08/04/21/61081885-11082121-image-a-28_1659645294669.jpg height=641 width=962 alt="Vans transporting jurors arrive at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Thursday.&nbsp;The building has been sealed off since the shooting, and the sight was deeply unsettling: Large pools of dried blood still stained classroom floors" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Vans transporting jurors arrive at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Thursday.&nbsp;The building has been sealed off since the shooting, and the sight was deeply unsettling: Large pools of dried blood still stained classroom floors</p><img decoding=async id=i-278e36f994102deb src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/08/04/21/61081641-11082121-image-m-6_1659644195200.jpg height=793 width=962 alt="School shooter Nikolas Cruz is led from the courtroom after he was sworn in and waved his right to be present at the school while the jury walks through the crime scene on Thursday" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><p class=imageCaption>School shooter Nikolas Cruz is led from the courtroom after he was sworn in and waved his right to be present at the school while the jury walks through the crime scene on Thursday</p><img decoding=async id=i-f2ad9f93da665a4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/08/04/21/61081401-11082121-image-a-8_1659644245800.jpg height=641 width=962 alt="Court deputies exit vans that transported jurors to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.

Hanging on a wall inside was a sign reading, ‘No Bully Zone.’ The creative writing assignment for the day was written on the whiteboard: ‘How to write the perfect love letter.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And still hanging on the wall of a second-floor hallway was a quote from James Dean: ‘Dream as if you´ll live forever, live as if you´ll die today.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Inside slain teacher Scott Beigel’s geography classroom, his laptop was still open on his desk.

Weinstein said prosecutors hope the visit to the school will be ‘the final piece in erasing any doubt that any juror might have had that the death penalty is the only recommendation that can be made.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Such site visits are rare. Weinstein, a former prosecutor, said in more than 150 jury trials dating back to the late 1980s, he has only had one.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One reason for their rarity is that they are a logistical nightmare for the judge, who needs to get the jury to the location and back to the courthouse without incident or risk a mistrial.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And in a typical case, a visit wouldn’t even present truthful evidence: After law enforcement leaves, the building or public space returns to its normal use. The scene gets cleaned up, objects get moved and repairs are made. It’s why judges order jurors in many trials not to visit the scene on their own.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Craig Trocino, a University of Miami law professor who has represented defendants appealing their death sentences, said the visit – combined with the myriad graphic videos and photos jurors have already seen – could open an avenue for Cruz’s attorneys if they find themselves in the same situation.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘At some point evidence becomes inflammatory and prejudicial,’ he said. ‘The site visit may be a cumulative capstone.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cruz’s attorneys have argued that prosecutors have used evidence not just to prove their case, but to inflame the jurors´ passions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6O2rLvLmqpmm6Kqx2621Kumq6tdq7a0tdNmq6GdXajBqrjLZpmlp5%2BZerTAwKKlnpxdna6tuNJmpp9loJa%2FrLjAp5tmq5OdvLC4jg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./copy-of-holy-water-font-with-metal-lid-nickel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Holy Water Font with Metal Lid">&larr;
