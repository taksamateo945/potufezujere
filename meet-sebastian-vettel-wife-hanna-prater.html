The celebrity wife was born in 1988, though the day and month of her birth are not known. She is a native of Heppenheim in West Germany and a German citizen who comes from a mixed ethnic background.</p><p>Prater has never mentioned her mother’s name but she is said to be an English woman while her dad who is equally not known hails from Germany. The German celebrity wife once said she grew up with a couple of siblings.</p><p>Hanna was a student at Heppenheim Middle school. Following her graduation, she went on to master the art of fashion design at Badan Wuttermberg Fashion School. She was a studious fashion student during her days in the tertiary institution and graduated as an expert in her field.</p><h2><strong>She is a Fashion Designer and Entrepreneur</strong></h2><p>After majoring in fabric and textiles at Badan Wuttermberg Fashion School, Hanna Prater went on to find employment in the fashion industry majorly working in print fashion.</p><p>The first company to employ her services was Look Magazine and she put in several years with the company as a stylist. Hanna also got the bulk of her experience while a staff of S. Oliver Fashion House.</p><p>Getting married and becoming a mother was what informed Prater’s decision to leave paid employment but while taking care of the home front, the mother of three is putting her own fashion accessory brand together.</p><h2><strong>Sebastian Vettel and Hanna Prater Began Dating in High School</strong></h2><p>There is a version of the story that claims Hanna Prater met the man who would become her spouse, Sebastian Vettel during a visit to the Heppenheim-based Starkenburg-Gymnasium. However, the most popular account says they met as students of Heppenheim Middle school in 2006.</p><p>Sebastian Vettel is a Formula One driver who has four prestigious racing championships under his belt, though he retired from active racing in 2022.</p><p>Seb and Hanna were obviously high school sweethearts and their relationship continued to endure even after graduation. It also survived when Seb had to relocate to Switzerland in furtherance of his career and Hanna remained in Germany. A few years later in 2010, Seb brought his love interest down to Swiss where they started living together in the home he acquired over there.</p><h2><strong>They Got married in a Private Ceremony in 2019</strong></h2><h2></h2><p>Four years after Hanna Prater relocated to Swiss, speculations started making the rounds that the couple tied the knot in 2014, just before becoming first-time parents. However, these claims were denied by Hanna and Seb who came out in 2017 to confirm that they were yet to get married and did not feel the need to put a ring on their relationship.</p><p>Their denials notwithstanding, Hanna and Sebastian Vettel wed in a private wedding in 2019 after becoming parents for the second time. Their first child was already five and the second one was four when they wedded. The Vettel family resides in a medieval-style farmhouse in Swiss. At the time of their wedding, Seb was already well-established in his career as a car racing champion.</p><h2><strong>The Couple is Enjoying an Enduring Marriage</strong></h2><p>Sebastian Vettel and Hanna Prater have been together for 17 years now and their love has proved to be an enduring one.</p><p>Perhaps the secret of their lasting relationship is the fact that Hanna and Seb keep their personal lives away from public scrutiny. In fact, they never opened up about making their relationship official. Fans and the media started suspecting them to be married after Seb was spotted in Canada with a wedding ring on his finger.</p><p>Being the secretive couple that they are, the Formula One driver went to France without the ring, plunging speculators into deeper confusion. However, the news of their wedding is no longer in doubt as neither of them denied it.</p><h2><strong>Hanna Prater is a Mother of Three</strong></h2><p>Hanna Prater and Sebastian Vettel have three children. The couple obviously did not wait for the benefit of a wedding ring before starting a family. They welcomed their first child Emilie Vettel on January 12, 2014. Little Emilie was five years old at her parent’s wedding and is currently 9.</p><p>Emilie became a big sister to the couple’s second daughter, Matilda Vettel who was born a year later in September 2015. Matilda is now 8. The only child of the couple that was born after their wedding is their third child and only son who came in 2019. It was a happy occasion for the Vettel family as Seb made sure to be with Hanna as she gave birth. The Formula One diver even had to give the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix’s media day a miss.</p><p>Even though their third child has already clocked three, Hanna Prater and her husband do not deem it necessary to reveal the little boy’s name. They even keep everything about their girls hidden.</p><p>Despite their secrecy, it is glaring that Hanna and Seb are dotting parents to their children. The fashionista quit her job to be a full-time mum and her husband once said he prefers to be called a husband and a dad than a Formula One driver. Seb had to retire early from car racing just to have ample time to spend with his family.</p><h2><b>She is Quite Supportive of her Husband</b></h2><p>Even though Hanna Prater is a private person that loves to stay very far from the limelight, it has become glaring that the mother of two supports her husband’s career. Her contributions to Seb’s career success have been quite noticeable and according to reports, Hanna is not just a homemaker, she also lends Sebastian a hand in managing his career obligations.</p><p>Despite her influential role, Hanna has never followed Seb to his racing events. When quizzed, the mother of three said the racing arena is Sebastian’s place of work and she wouldn’t dream of going there to distract him. Hanna only accompanies Seb to social events and functions.</p><p>Hanna lives a simple life which is quite uncommon among wives of celebs. Her humility and simplicity have been greatly admired by her spouse’s fans. They see her as a genuine person and not just another celebrity spouse stealing the spotlight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmqp6akajBqq3NZq2erKSauW7DyJ%2BcZqCRo7uiec%2BrmK2domQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./christina-applegate-expresses-her-joy-after-receiving-a-star-on-the-hollywood-walk-of-fame.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christina Applegate Expresses Her Joy After Receiving A Star On The Hollywood Walk Of Fame">&larr;
