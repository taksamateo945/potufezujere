He is one of the six children that Lil Durk has fathered thus far.</strong></p><p>Zayden Banks’ father, Lil Durk, has been active in the entertainment industry since 2010 and has become a famous name across the United States of America and indeed the world at large. His fame has rubbed off on the people around him, especially his romantic partners and the kids he has had with them.</p><p>Being one of Lil Durk’s 6 kids, Zayden, though a minor, has managed to command the interest of a lot of people who are fans of the rapper from Chicago. Apart from things like when he was born, the circumstances surrounding his birth and the identity of his mother are among the often asked questions about Zayden.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Zayden Banks’ Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Zayden Banks</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> November 5, 2013</li><li><strong>Zayden Banks’ Age</strong>: 10 Years</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> African American</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Scorpio</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Muslim</li><li><strong>Zayden Banks’ Parents</strong>: Lil Durk (Father)</li><li><strong>Siblings:&nbsp;</strong>Five (Skyler, Willow, Du’mier, Angelo, and Bella Bank)</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being the Son of a Famous Rapper</li><li><strong>Instagram: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>@zayden_banks</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Who Is Zayden Banks, Lil Durk’s Son?</strong></h2><p>Zayden Banks, s the third child and second son of Lil Durk. His claim to fame is primarily because of who his father is; apart from this, there is not much to tell about Zayden’s life. Born to the famous American rapper in late 2013, Zayden, by the virtue of who his father is, is an African-American and of course, a citizen of the United States of America.</p><p>Much is yet to be learned about the identity of Zayden Banks’ paternal grandmother. We can only tell that the woman who is said to be a nurse in some quarters, gave birth to Zayden’s father Lil Durk on the 19th of October 1992.</p><p>His paternal grandfather is Dontay Banks who is known to many as Big Durk. As fate would have it, Big Durk has been a part of Zayden’s childhood and upbringing; something he couldn’t do for his son Lil Durk. Dontay was arrested for drug-related crimes when Zayden Banks’ father was only seven months old. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>He was subsequently incarcerated for many years</a> which denied him the opportunity to raise Lil Durk.</p><h2><strong>What is Zayden Banks’ Age Now?</strong></h2><p>Zayden Banks is currently 10 years old. According to various reports, the second son of the famous rapper from Chicago was born on the 5th of November 2013.</p><p>Given his age, one can’t tell what the future holds for Zayden. He has a lot of growing up to do and attempting to predict what he would do for a living is a futile quest at the moment</p><p>Zayden is the third oldest child of the rapper and like all his other kids, it seems Lil Durk shares custody of Zayden with his mother. We believe so because there has never been a report of a custody battle that involved Zayden.</p><h3><strong>Who is Zayden Banks’ Mother?</strong></h3><p>Zayden Bank’s mom is Sheena Gia, a beauty and fitness entrepreneur who also has a clothing brand. Zayden Banks’ father has been romantically linked to several women since he came to the limelight but not all of them are known to the public. As far as the public knows, his first romantic partner was Nicole Covone, the mother of his first two kids whom he reportedly started dating in 2008.</p><p>Years later, he dated a lady named Tameka Kute and is currently in a relationship with India Royale to whom he is engaged. None of these women is Zayden Banks’ mother: whoever his mother is, she is one of the romantic partners of the rapper who has remained unknown to the public.</p><p>We can only confirm that Lil Durk was involved with Zayden Banks’ mother around the same time he was dating Nicole Covone. Durk and Nicole welcomed their second child together, a daughter named Bella in 2013. That same year, the rapper welcomed Zayden with a woman whose identity was not known to the public at the time.</p><h2><strong>He is the Third of Lil Durk’s Children and Has a Total of Five Siblings</strong></h2><p>As stated earlier, Lil Durk has a total of six kids thus far. The hip-hop star once disclosed that he intends to have as many as ten children, so we anticipate he would father more kids in the nearest future.</p><p>At the moment, his kids are six in number which means that Zayden Banks has five siblings thus far: two older siblings and three younger ones. His oldest sibling, Angelo Banks, who is also the first son of Lil Durk, was born in August 2011. Next in line is an older sister named Bella who was born in 2013.</p><p>Zayden Banks’ father had both Angelo and Bella with his ex-girlfriend, Nicole Coven. It was after the two that he welcomed Zayden with an unknown woman. Thereafter, the rapper welcomed his fourth child, another son named Du’mier, and then his fifth and second daughter named Skyler Banks.</p><p>Willow Banks is Zayden Banks’ youngest sibling at the moment. The third daughter of Lil Durk was born in 2018 and is the only child the American rapper has with his fiancee, India Royale.</p><h3><strong>Zayden Banks is Active on Social Media with Thousands of Followers</strong></h3><p>Many famous figures have been relentless about protecting their kids from the negativity that comes from the public attention they get. Others don’t mind and go as far as creating social media pages for their kids. Zayden Banks belongs to the latter category.</p><p>Although he is yet to become a teenager, he is active on social media, especially on Instagram where he commands thousands of followers. Although his Instagram account is private, he has over 2.6k as of March 2022.</p><p>Lil Durk’s experiences in the early years of his life have made him committed to raising Zayden Banks and his siblings to the best of his ability. Over the years, he has been involved in many gang-related crimes and run-ins with the law. But for the sake of Zayden and his other kids, Lil Durk is cleaning up his act to be the best father for his children.</p><h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><h4><strong>Who is Zayden Banks?</strong></h4><p>Zayden Banks is the son of Lil Durk, the famous American rapper.
